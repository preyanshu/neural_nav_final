Problem - Mental health is an essential component of overall health. It is the foundation of an individual's well-being and 
	    effective functioning.
	    Unfortunately, most people overlook this aspect of health, which frequently results in extreme actions like suicide.
	    According to National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB), in 2021 around 1.65 lacs people committed suicide with an increase
	    of 7.2% from the previous year.
	    According to the most recent National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) survey, almost 150 million
	    Indians require mental health care services, but only about 30 million seek them. So, what about the rest?

Solution - Mental Health Care should be accessible, affordable, convenient and comfortable.
	     All people in need should have quick access to therapists whenever they require one.
	     But we all know that therapists cannot be everywhere at all times.
	     Hence, we are here with a solution to cater to all the current needs and concerns.

Project Description - Our undertaking Neural Nav is a chatbot that offers an innovative and personalised approach to mental health 
			    and well-being.
			    Our chatbot is here to help users overcome their sadness, depression, and grief.
			    Our chatbot is a free, easy-to-use, comfortable, and convenient solution that allows customers to get assistance
			    whenever they require.
			    And we're excited to announce that we will be introducing it in the form of a website and an Android app for the
			    well-being of society.
